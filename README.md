# liveview_elixirconf_2021
LiveView course for ElixirConf

## 1 Install these tools, plus Elixir, plus Phoenix. 

The tools you will need to install: 

- zoom 
- git (https://git-scm.com/downloads). 
- an editor that you are comfortable with. 
- a working PostgreSQL install

For the development dependencies, you'll need: 

- Elixir 1.11, with OTP 23 or OTP 24. Make sure it's working: 

run the command: 

```
[course] ➔ elixir -v
Erlang/OTP 23 [erts-11.0] [source] [64-bit] [smp:12:12] [ds:12:12:10] [async-threads:1] [hipe]

Elixir 1.11.2 (compiled with Erlang/OTP 23)
```

- node.js. Not optional! for Phoenix assets (I'm running npm -v 6.13.4)
- Phoenix 1.5.7+ (It includes LiveView.)


Is Phoenix working? Make sure you can run this command: 

```
mix phx.new demo --live
(say yes to fetch dependencies and assets)
```

and make sure you can then create the database: 

```
cd demo
mix ecto.create
```

Don't save this for the last minute! There are a few dependencies that will give you trouble if you've never done this before and decide to wait.
